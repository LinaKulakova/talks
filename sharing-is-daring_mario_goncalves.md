Description
-----------

We all love sharing the cool things we build and, through OSS achievements like Git(Hub) and package managers, the quality standards it allowed the software industry to rise to. So much so that portability and modularity is now a development requirement.

Everything comes at a cost. Sharing code, specially at scale, is no exception. 

This talk will identify and dissect those hidden costs, blockers and challenges and analyze how different code sharing models and techniques balance those caveats.

Speaker Bio
-----------

Hello, I'm Mário: a Software Engineer at [Sky](https://www.linkedin.com/company/skyportugal/), a teacher at [Wild Code School](https://wildcodeschool.pt/) and a geek at ❤️.

I've been working in Web Development since 2008, with a strong focus on Frontend (JS) and experience in the Training, Advertisement and Media industries. Currently part of the team who's building NBCU's streaming platform, [Peacock](https://www.peacocktv.com).

Having worked with and on several Open Source projects, internal libraries and multi-client, large-scale projects, these are topics I hold dear: code reusability, distribution and engineering collaboration.
