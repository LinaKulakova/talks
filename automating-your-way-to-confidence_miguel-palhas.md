Description
-----------

We recently re-thinked the way we handle releases within our product team. The goal was to make everything more agile, automated, and a lot more transparent towards the rest of our company.
Around the same time, Github Actions went to public beta, and it ended up fitting our needs nicely. It also turned out that this CI has a lot more to offer than I was previously used to.

This talk is about our journey to make better and faster releases, about how I'm trying to deprecate our project managers, and about how awesome Github Actions can be.

Along the way, I'll show examples of how we, at [Utrust](https://utrust.com) are handling this process nowadays, as well as some other automations we built for our product team, which ended up saving us tens of hours of headaches during 2019.

Speaker Bio
-----------

I have a history of being both lazy and an over-engineer. I'll spend hours
tweaking that one vim config that will save me seconds later on.
For the past two years I've been focused on building the infrastructure for UTRUST (https://utrust.com/), which is a payment platform for cryptocurrencies.
I mostly use Elixir and Rust nowadays, and I have a passion for writing not just
code that works, but code that is meaningful and maintainable, as well as
teaching other on how to do the same.
