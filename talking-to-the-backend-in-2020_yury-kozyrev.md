Description
-----------

Over a decade REST was the main communication protocol between Frontend and Backend.
But things are changing and in 2020 we have enough options that are mature to use them in production for the company or fun enough to try it in the startup.
After the Pixels Camp 2019 I've got involved into multiple projects with different needs and different maturity state (and different amount of the legacy code) and had chance to gain experience in designing communication schemas between frontend and the backend apps and hands-on experience leading the implementation.

Im this talk I'd like to cover pros and cons in short and lond distance for:
- Old good REST JSON-based communication
- Modern GraphQL
- gRPC which is coming to WEB after if become nearly a gold standard for the communication berween backend microservices
- Backendless options like fancy Firebase (offering auth, realtime data syncronization, and other perks) or self-hosted CouchDB

I will talk about hidden and known pitfalls of this technologies you might face and options to avoid it.
