Murphy Law in the Age of the Internet-of-Things

Description
-----------

With the promise of improving our well-being, ~smart~ devices permeated our lives on an unforeseen scale and became a significant influence on our daily tasks. From Google Home assistant to Amazon Ring doorbells, most of these devices suffer from some *bad* design decisions in terms of security, safety, interoperability, or intolerance to network failures. And, even if most of these systems are not *mission critical*, and their malfunctions, most of the times, do not provoke severe damage or are life-threatening, they push back IoT from an enhancement to a burden on our daily lives.

In this talk I will delve into IoT systems from a Murphy perspective --- *whatever can go wrong, will go wrong* --- and why these systems are mostly unreliable, insecure and privacy-threatening. From the *naive* Mirai botnet incident to laser-powered attacks on smart assistants, giving some Portuguese examples, I expect to raise awareness on the compromises that we are making when we bring these devices home, even if they are fun to play with.
