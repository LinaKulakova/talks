Description
-----------

Just as, for engineers, pair programming means two engineers working together, PM pairing refers to two Product Managers working together as part of the same product team. 

However, there are little resources available regarding pairing for Product Managers. That's because it's not too common.

What does pairing really mean for PMs? How is it different from pair programming? Why is it great? Why does it suck? When is it good to pair? And more than that, how to make the most of it when you do pair?
 
I aim to share my lessons learned and tips & tricks about pairing for PMs (from own experience), to give you more insights on this topic.

Extra Information
-----------------

The purpose of this talk is to offer more information regarding pairing practices for Product Managers to to help:
* those who have not heard of pairing for PMs, learn more about it; 
* those who have heard about it but have not considered pairing in their product teams: start considering it and weigh options around benefits for their products/business;
* those who have tried it: open a conversation about advantages/disadvantages and exchange knowledge.
