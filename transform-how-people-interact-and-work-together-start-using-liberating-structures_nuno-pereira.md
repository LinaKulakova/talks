===========================================================================

* Speaker   : Nuno Silva Pereira
* Available : first and second day
* Length    : Hands-on Workshop - 2 hours
* Language  : English

## Description

Change the way you interact with your friends, colleagues and co-workers!

With Liberating Structures, you will be able to _achieve better results than what is possible with conventional methods_ (presentations, reports, etc.). This informal and simple approach allows people to work at the top of their intelligence and creativity, while enjoying their work.

In this **2h workshop you will experience hands-on how to apply Liberating Structures into your touchpoints** (meetings, retrospectives, brainstorms, stand-ups, workshops, inceptions,â€¦).

Together, we will see how to structure one of those touchpoints using different Liberating Structures, in order to:
 - Accomodate groups of any size
 - Make your touchpoints engaging and simple
 - Give everyone equal opportunity to contribute
 - Maximize active participation while reducing bias
