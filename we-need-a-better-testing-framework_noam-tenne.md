Description
-----------

Python has a super rich and active ecosystem, and py.test is great, but I believe we deserve a better testing framework.
This is why I've built a new framework and DSL named "Nimoy".
Using Nimoy, I set out to make Python testing beautiful, expressive, pragmatic and fun.

Speaker Bio
-----------

A hacker-hearted software engineer and DevOps cowboy. Noam has spent the past decade working on both cloud based and on-premise platforms, gaining much experience in building scalable, mission critical systems ranging from software delivery, to medical devices and IoT. You may have also heard him speak at conferences such as DevOps Days, PyCon, Jenkins User Conference and Gr8conf. His love of creation isn't limited to programming, so he has co-created and co-founded podcasts, meetups, unconferences and music. Noam is now wreaking havoc at VanMoof Bicycles.

I'm a fairly experienced speaker. For the past 6 years I've given at least 2 talks every year at international conferences and meetups.
