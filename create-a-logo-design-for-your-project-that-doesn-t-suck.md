Description
-----------

Your project could have the best idea, and the most elegant code, but when you need to promote and share it on social networks where the 3-second rule speaks best, and you only have is a README file, it can be hard to grab your audience attention â€“ it needs to "POP"!

So, instead of bothering again your cousin (that has a degree in design) for another logo and some artwork, what if you can make yourself?

Join me and discover easy ways for you to:

- [ ] find a great name
- [ ] design a custom Logo
- [ ] create a brand around the idea
- [ ] design some marketing swag (everybody loves swag)
- [ ] design appealing artworks to share on social networks
- [ ] think a bit outside of the box

#### Why me?

Despite having a degree on programming, and actually being paid to code, I've always have a special taste and care for design â€“ specially smart design, a.k.a. Design Thinking.

And during this year I've started to help a friend of mine to brand some popular PHP projects, such as: Laravel Zero, PHP Insights, PHP-Plus, etcâ€¦ And from a crazy idea during this month I opened up a *Call-For-Logos* ([twitter.com/Caneco/status/1179463831170486273](https://twitter.com/Caneco/status/1179463831170486273)) during the Hacktoberfest, and by the end of the marathon I had done **30 logos**, for open-source projects ðŸŽ‰
