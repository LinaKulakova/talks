Description
-----------

What if I told you that you don't need to have a graduation on design to actually make yourself a pretty logo for you project?
Just the right combination of a font, an icon, colours, and a drop of classy gradients and your  project will stand-out between the others.

Creating a logo for you project can be hard, specially for someone that it's that good in design. So the goal of this talk is to show that's not exactly rocket science.

We start out with a name of a random project selected, and from there we gradually setup our design: select an icon, choose a good font, and colour with a jazzy palette.

After listening to this talk, you will get the main idea of how to design and create logos for your projects.

#### Why me?

Despite having a degree on programming, and actually being paid to code, I've always have a special taste and care for design â€“ specially smart design, a.k.a. Design Thinking.

And during this year I've started to help a friend of mine to brand some popular PHP projects, such as: Laravel Zero, PHP Insights, PHP-Plus, etcâ€¦ And from a crazy idea during this month I opened up a *Call-For-Logos* ([twitter.com/Caneco/status/1179463831170486273](https://twitter.com/Caneco/status/1179463831170486273)) during the Hacktoberfest, and by the end of the marathon I had done **30 logos**, for open-source projects ðŸŽ‰
