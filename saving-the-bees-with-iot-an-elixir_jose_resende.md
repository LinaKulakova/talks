Description
-----------

Bees are dying at an incredible speed and if we don't find a solution we are going to die with them. 

This talk documents the design and creation of a plataform to help beekeepers get funding, metrics, health warnings and tips for their hives.

This will include the techonology behind it, Elixir, and how it helped us build an mvp with minimal fuss. 

Long live the bees üêù
