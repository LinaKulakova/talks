Description
-----------

Blockchains are terrible, slow, fragile distributed databases.
If you have a project in front of you, and one of your options is to try blockchain there somehow — please stop.
No, really, don't; you'll regret it.
Even that Long Blockchain iced tea company didn't make it ;-).

Blockchains are exciting, groundbreaking, empowering socio-technical constructs.
This means that they allow you to solve a whole novel class of problems, problems for which you didn't have any solution before.
Problems you probably used to ignore, thinking they are "just the way things are".
Trust problems; social scalability and coordination problems; privacy and data control and ownership problems.

If you learn to identify those in your business, and match them with our newly discovered toolkit of distributed, (almost) trustless computer systems — then and only then blockchain technology might actually help you to get ahead and achieve a thing unachievable for your competition.

In this talk I'll try to cast away all technical lingo and all zealotry usually associated with the blockchain scene, and focus on honestly identifying the possibilities and applications.
I will never mention solutions of my company nor our competitors in the space while doing so, keeping the conversation high-level, non-promotional and intellectually fair.

Speaker Bio

I'm Head of Security at Parity Technologies — a company which develops opensource technology for decentralized systems and helps customers (proudly including United Nations) to build on top of it.
Before Parity I developed nontrivial application backends as a CTO of my own startup, and worked on continuously delivering web-facing services for SUSE Linux.
