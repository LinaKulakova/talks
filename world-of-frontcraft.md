Extra Information

#### Why me?

On the Front-side of Development I can say that I've tinkered all the big JavaScript frameworks; tested all the major CSS frameworks and their pre and post-processors; tried the most common module bundlers; and as expected, I even once tried to make my own Bootstrap.

I know the pain of deciding the right stack, the happiness of getting it right… or the shame of having a project with a bad codebase.
