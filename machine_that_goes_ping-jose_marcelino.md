Description
-----------

{{ "Hardware is Hard" is a common saying and often true as developing hardware traditionally requires a great number of skills, years of experience and - sometimes expensive - tools.

In this hands-on, practical workshop, we will challenge this notion through the recent developments around Python on low cost microcontrollers,  MicroPython - now spreading in a similarity to how BASIC was ported to almost every machine and drove the microcomputer revolution of the late 1970s.

We will introduce low power wide area (LPWAN) wireless networks made for IoT such as Sigfox, LoRa and NB-IoT and demonstrate how to connect your MicroPython device to them in an efficient way.

Finally we will take the next step - and make the "Ping" part of the title true - by introducing SCHC (pronounced Chic), the new IETF protocol which enables IPv6 over those LPWANs }}

Note: Bring your computer for the hands-on part - you will get your a node to program and play with ( usually restricted to 20 places,  maybe possible to share devices between attendees )

Speaker Bio
-----------

{{ Originally from Setubal, Portugal Jose is the IoT Solutions Architect at Omnium Sensing, part of a large Engineering group in the North East of UK - the epicentre of the indutrial revulution of the 1800s.

Previous workplaces have included Pycom - makers of popular ESP32 based MicroPython boards with ample connectivity options - and his company Metavurt.

He has experience in applying various sensor and connectivity options - Bluetooth, LoRa, Sigfox, and LTE/NB-IoT - to 'mine' new information and opportunities from existing systems. When not soldering something or trying some new chip he's a regular speaker at various IoT Meetups (Newcastle, Leeds, Amsterdam) and larger events such as Things Conference.

Other interests include studying generalised networks and their applications e.g. in brain connectivity. }}
