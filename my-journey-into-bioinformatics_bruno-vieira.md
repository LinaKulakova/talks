=================================================

* Speaker   : Bruno Vieira
* Available : Any day
* Length    : 60 minutes
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

How are technologies and programming languages such as Node.js, Python, Docker, NixOS, and Machine Learning used in science, specifically in genomics?
I will talk about my unusual career path in academia, how I founded the open source project Bionode.io, ended up working for startups, and advocating open science for Mozilla. I will show how we are currently trying to find cures for many diseases at Resurgo with powerful computing and tools, mixed with gene editing.

Speaker Bio
-----------

Co-CTO at Resurgo Genetics, an antisense therapeutics target discovery company. Submitted a PhD at WurmLab, Queen Mary University of London.

Scientist by education and programmer by profession.

Founded and lead Bionode.io, an Open Source community to build scalable code and tools for bioinformatics by leveraging Node.js.

In 2016, the Mozilla Science Lab awarded me a 10 month fellowship to travel around the world and champion open science through workshops and hackathons.

Worked for research labs and startups, I enjoy being at the intersection of industry and academia.
