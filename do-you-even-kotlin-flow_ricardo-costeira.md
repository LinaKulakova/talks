## Description

Reactive programming is here to stay.
Most Android devs nowadays are used to sprinkle RxJava throughout their apps, even if they don't actually have use for reactive streams and just want to simplify thread scheduling. However, it's also true that more and more devs are becoming aware that Rx is an overkill for their use case, and long for better options.
Kotlin Flow is one of the new additions to the Kotlin coroutines library, and is meant to bring reactive streams to the coroutine world. But is it as powerful as RxJava?
In this talk, I'll explore what Kotlin Flow is, how can it be used, and how can it imbue our apps with the power of reactive programming.
