Machine Learning at the Edge
=================================================

* Speaker   : [Claudio Teixeira](https://pixels.camp/claudiotx)
* Length    : 45
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

In a lot of situations we can't afford to call an API to interpret our payload on a Machine Learning model due to performance (real-time), connectivity and privacy concerns, so that we need to run ML on the edge devices (IoT, Browser, Smartphones). These constraints open a path to a new way of creating and running ML Models. I will be presenting some present and future use cases followed by a (quick && easy) demo which any developer can follow along an we will be training and running a realtime ML model on our browsers, completly isolated from any service or API.
