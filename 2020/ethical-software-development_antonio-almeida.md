* Length    : 45 minutes
* Language  : English, Portuguese

Description
-----------

The late 2010s featured numerous privacy and ethical scandals involving tech giants such as Facebook and Google. A wave of technical activists have risen to fight this and related issues, such as climate emergency, sustainable startup funding, and big tech lobbying.

In other words, Software is now political.

What is the role of the average Software Engineer in these fights? This talk will show what choices of the software development cycle have an impact and how we're unwillingly part of the problem, specially in cloud based software. 

I'll provide guidelines and concrete technical solutions towards fully ethical software while maintaining professional standards.
