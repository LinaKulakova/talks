LiveQuiz: Building a rich, real-time webapp without JS
=================================================

* Speaker   : [Daniel Caixinha](https://pixels.camp/dcaixinha)
* Length    : 120 minutes
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

Modern JavaScript tooling enables sophisticated client-side applications. However, this often comes at an extreme cost in complexity and maintainability, as we need to duplicate part of the business logic across the server and the client.

In this workshop we'll build a dynamic, real-time web application without having to write Javascript! This application will be powered by Elixir, Phoenix LiveView and WebSockets, which allows us to have a stateful view through server-rendered HTML.
