Description
-----------

John started at Cloudflare when there were about 20 employees, and he was the lone member of the London office. Today nearly 1,300 people are working at Cloudflare, spread across 13 offices, including a new one in Portugal. The company now runs one of the world's largest networks, spanning 194 cities in 90+ countries.

In this relaxed fireside chat, we will ask John about the challenges that come with hiring and scaling a team, how to grow without sacrificing culture, and how to build products that solve real problems.

Also, while we're at it, our inquiring minds will want to know how's been life in Lisbon so far and what it's like to live under the permanent temptation of great food and good weather. We might even throw a quiz on variations of cod dishes, in Portuguese.
