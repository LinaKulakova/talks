Beyond REST: GraphQL vs gRPC Web
=================================================

* Speaker   : [Yury Kozyrev][https://pixels.camp/urakozz]
* Length    : 45min + 15min QA
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

Over a decade REST was the main communication protocol between Frontend and Backend. But things are changing and in 2020 we have enough options that are mature to use in production in a company or fun enough to try out in a startup.

Over the past year, I've got involved in multiple projects with different needs and different development stages (and different amounts of the legacy code) and had a chance to gain experience in designing communication schemes between frontend and backend apps and gained the hands-on experience leading the implementation.

In this talk, I'd like to cover the pros and cons in a short- and long-run of:
- Old good REST JSON-based communication
- Modern GraphQL
- gRPC coming to WEB after it became nearly a gold standard of backend microservices communication
- **Bonus**: Backendless options like self-hosted CouchBase or fancy cloud Firebase (offering auth, realtime data synchronization, and other perks)

I will then discuss the hidden and known pitfalls of these technologies that you might encounter and ways to avoid them.
