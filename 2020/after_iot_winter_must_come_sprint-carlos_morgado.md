Description

Connected fridges. Connected toasters. Connected toothbrushes. Connected sippy cups. We are living the winter of IoT. In the excitement vendors just added awkward connectivity to poorly designed products resulting in a frustrating experience and an appalling security record.

But after winter must come spring and we’ll go through emerging technologies like 5G and eSIM and what’s happening to help app developers and IoT makers overcome the challenges of getting products connected to services.
