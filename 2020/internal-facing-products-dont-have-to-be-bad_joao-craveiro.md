Internal-Facing Products Don't Have to Be Bad
=============================================

* Speaker   : [João Craveiro](https://pixels.camp/jpgcc)
* Length    : 60 minutes (including Q&A)
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

Shiny stuff for your customers, a clunky backoffice auto-generated from the database schema using the default Bootstrap template for your own colleagues — sounds familiar?

Customer-facing products often have internal-facing tools — either to directly provide parts of the service the product offers, or power supporting functions (growth, customer / technical support). They're often not thought of as products, and given just enough attention to produce a low-quality tool that “kind of does the trick” — even when they support a critical part of the service the product provides. The idea of this talk is to defend, using real examples of internal-facing products, why it makes sense to give these internal-facing tools the same treatment as customer-facing ones, and how to ensure they’re valued throughout the company.
