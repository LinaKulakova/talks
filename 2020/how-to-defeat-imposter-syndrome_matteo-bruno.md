Description
-----------

Do you feel like you don't belong, you don't deserve what you achieved, everyone in your office is more talented than you? Do you have imposter syndrome... too?

Imposter syndrome is common across all industries, but the increasing pressure to be successful in IT is taking its toll on employees, affecting more than half workers, me included :)

After many years working in tech for a lot of companies (from startups to big corporations) in many business fields, I found a way to overcome self-doubt and turn this weird feeling in a booster for greater achievements... and I want to share it with you!

Señor software engineer, pizza lover, traveller, runner, blockchain & crypto enthusiast (sometimes not in this order :) ).

I’ve started programming @ 12yo, and since then I aimed to develop software, fostering my ability to lead complex projects within a multi-cultural environment, always continuing learning and improving my skills.

After 4 years in Milan, working for Viacom as Senior Software Engineer, taking care of their international sites and APIs, on January 2019 I decided to move to Barcelona and face a new challenge, working for Europcar Mobility Group on the Connected Cars Platform. 

Currently working as Senior Software Engineer & Golang chapter co-captain @ Europcar Mobility Group (BCN)
