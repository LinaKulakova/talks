Description
-----------

As of 2019H1, Unbabel's translation pipeline was still using an evolving codebase whose first commit was made by the current CEO in 2013. It is safe to say it has some shortcomings and failings.
In this talk I'll tell a story on how we leapfrogged our old v1.0 architecture and built a much simpler, easier to maintain and scale system.


Speaker Bio
-----------

I’m a Software Engineer with 15 years of experience including start-ups and leading software corporations in three countries. I dive deep and take an end-to-end perspective. I'm always looking for hard problems to crack and high quality solutions. I currently work on the new architecture of Unbabel's translation services. Previously I worked on diverse problems such as backends for Citymapper's mobile apps, large scale distributed systems for Microsoft and Amazon Web Services where I launched DynamoDB, the world leading NoSQL Cloud Database, which led to co-authoring 13 US patents. I’m both a Maker and Manager. Problems are waiting to be solved.
