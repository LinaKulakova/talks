Description
-----------

Can machines learn to program and design their own software? Can they give developers and designers more time to focus on value and more creative tasks?

Software is the ultimate tool but with great power comes a lot of [yak shaving][2]. Why is software still so hard to write, test, and design? Tools have improved but the complexity of users’ and business needs have been increasing. We need to catch up!

In this talk I will talk about how we see the evolution of software development aided by AI, making it accessible to more people. I'll go over some of the underlying techniques, trends and challenges in this emerging area of research. Learn about how combining Graph Neural Networks, Automated Reasoning and other areas of AI are making this possible and and how this represents one of the proposed paths towards Artificial General Intelligence.
