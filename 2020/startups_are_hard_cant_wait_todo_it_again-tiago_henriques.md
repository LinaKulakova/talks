Description
-----------

5 years ago, I opened my own startup. In a country where I didn't speak any of the native languages, without having ever gone to business school, without understanding what is needed to create a company. This talk is about how an idea that started as a group of friends doing research for fun and an event much like this one that we find ourselves in today, that turned into a startup that later got acquired, our ups and downs, the things I did wrong and right.

My name is Tiago Henriques, I was the ex-CEO of BinaryEdge up until a few months when it got acquired by Coalition, a cyber insurer. I love all things security, data and how I can make insurance better using both of those.
