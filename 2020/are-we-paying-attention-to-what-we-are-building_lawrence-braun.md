=================================================

* Speaker   : [Lawrence Braun](https://pixels.camp/mstrlaw)
* Length    : 60 minutes
* Language  : English

Description
-----------
When we conceptualize and build products, we make decisions on a daily basis that affect our users more than we may think. We want to delight them with our products but also need to drive their behavior in hopes of achieving our goals. This talk is about exploring how seemingly small things can have ethical/moral implications and how technology can be a double-edged sword.

Extra Information
-----------------
This is less of a technical talk and more of an invitation to reflect on how, as technologists, we have the capacity to affect the world and how this capacity can be put to use (good and bad).
