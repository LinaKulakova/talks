Description
-----------

Our online existence relies on an outdated and fragile idea of passwords. The password is what lies between a malicious user and your bank account or social media accounts. Passwords are hard to maintain; it's hard to store them on the server (passwords get stolen). They're hard to memorize, or not tell to others (phishing attacks).

But there's a better way! A passwordless world, and it just became a standard by W3C and FIDO on your browser.

An API that allows servers to register and authenticate users using public-key cryptography instead of a password, an API that uses cryptography in a user-accessible way.

This presentation is the result of the learning experiences done by implementing Webauthn for vert.x, a polyglot reactive toolkit.

In a tutorial format, you will learn what FIDO, FIDO2, U2F, CTAP, CTAP2, Webauthn is, how to create a secure web application that will work on your laptop or mobile device or security tokens. You will learn how to perform the server attestations and make secure phishing free applications.

I'm Paulo and I've used my 10+ years of software development experience writing, rewriting, banging my head against the wall, editing and re-editing high-performance web application to make Vert.x an even more awesome framework. I am also the author of "ES4X" the fastest JavaScript server runtime and other small open source projects. This is more than a job; I'm on a mission to build fast and faster applications!
