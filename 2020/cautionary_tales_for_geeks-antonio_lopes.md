Cautionary Tales for Geeks
=================================================

* Speaker   : [António Lopes](https://pixels.camp/antoniolopes)
* Length    : 60 minutes (including time for questions/discussion)
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

This is not a technical talk. There are already many (and very good) technical talks on Pixels.camp. This one is more about the fact that we can learn a lot about other fields (like psychology, sociology, marketing, economics, etc.) and especially about their mistakes and the way they can help us become better people (and professionals). I'm fascinated by cautionary tales and by what we can learn from them. With this talk I hope you'll be too.

I've been a teacher (mostly about programming) for several years, but now I'm a programmer that leads a team of other programmers at a public University in Lisbon. When I find the extra time, I'm also an Artificial Intelligence researcher that is trying to work on the emergence of intelligence through large groups of cooperative agents, a.k.a., Skynet. The fact that I haven't been chased by beings from the future, probably means I won't be successful.

Extra Information
-----------------

I've studied and worked on several different fields throughout my personal and professional life. This is mainly fueled by my will to constantly learn new things. The downside of this approach to life is that I'm also constantly making beginner's mistakes. That's why it's so important to learn from other people's mistakes.

This talk presents a set of stories (from other fields that may not be related to technology) that usually involve some sort of mistake or mishap, each with a specific lesson that can be learned and applied to the way we geeks operate.

I've had a previous talk at Pixels.camp about how a badly-designed algorithm for coordinating thousands of intelligent agents turned out to be a very good music composer: Bad Algorithms Make Great Music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG1IBCwbGe8. So I guess a pattern is emerging here: I like to turn mistakes into a positive thing.
