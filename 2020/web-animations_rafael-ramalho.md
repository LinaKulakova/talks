Rafael spent his early career days developing full-stack applications that focused on solving client problems. Heâ€™s a declared swiss army knife, which helped him quickly evolve to try and find fast and scalable solutions in every code he produces.
Thanks to the opportunity to create optimised, as well as good-looking, animations in Pixelmatters, Rafael started to have a taste for finding smart and intuitive ways to animate the web. While working at Blip, Rafael had to carefully plan and deliver high-performing animations for millions of users.
Currently working at MOXY, Rafael is feeling the urge to share all the knowledge he gained throughout the years thanks to his involvement with the open-source community. His passion about animations has led him to give talks targeted to Designers, Product Owners and Developers in order to help them achieve and deliver smooth web-animations.
