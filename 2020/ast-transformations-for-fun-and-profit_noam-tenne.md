Description
-----------

Let’s get intimate with Go and have fun with the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST, for short) package.
AST transformation is not a pie-in-the-sky technique, and familiarizing yourself with Go’s AST will 
add a very powerful tool to your figurative developer tool-belt.
In this session I will talk about what are AST transformations and what they can do for you.
We’ll review AST in theory, the important parts of the core ast package and see how we can use it to solve real world problems.

Extra Information
-----------------

I’m very fond of messing around with AST.
I’ve preached it during my Groovy development days, I’ve built a whole python framework based on it and used it to solve real world problems with Go.
Quite a number of developers that I’ve met were wary about the subject, feeling that it’s a “hacky” way of getting things done. I couldn’t disagree more. I’d really like to help developers feel comfortable with the topic, as one can achieve many great things with it.
