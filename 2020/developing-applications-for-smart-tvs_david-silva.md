=================================================

Description
-----------

Smart TVs invaded our homes and are currently part of our lives, but the number of applications available in their stores is reduced and not very diverse. 

This can be justified because people are actually not interested in developing apps for them for several reasons (JavaScript being a strong one) or because the documentation may appear outdated or difficult to understand for newcomers.

In this talk I am going to present the state of the art of Smart TV development and some techniques that any one can use to get started and develop their own.

I will be mostly focused on using Angular as the starting framework for app development and I intend to showcase some of my homebrew applications made for these devices as a starting point for others to do the same.

Some of the instructions given in this talk will be targeted at LG TVs but they should work with minor changes for other Smart TVs as well.

I am a full-stack developer at Satcom International AG and I am passionate for almost everything tech related as long as I find it challenging.

I began playing with web technologies when I was 16, exploring the world of WordPress and creating custom plugins and Multisite installations, and I haven't stopped learning new things ever since.

I started my professional carreer as Junior Researcher at IEETA where I developed a web-based solution for evaluation the compliance of PACS applications with the DICOM standard. After that, I joined Satcom as a front-end engineer working with Angular and I'm still working in that same company, now as a full stack developer.

During my free time I like to develop some side projects and to read about web development, mobile, security and devops.
