Description
-----------

Scrum and the Agile mindset have become the _de facto_ way of work in companies who require software development, and this sometimes clashes with the Communication and Marketing Departments way of work.

This talk is a description of the friction that can arise between these two stakeholders, and how to bridge the gap between the developers and the marketeers.
