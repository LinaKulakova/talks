Description
-----------

Identity online continues to evolve; governments, businesses, the open-source community, and grassroots organizations are all evolving how we validate, protect, and secure our identity. Whether your software is targeted towards companies or consumers, how you ethically manage customer identity will be crucial to your productâ€™s success (or existence).

In this talk, I cover the evolution of identity of the internet, from a product development perspective. I talk about the things you should be aware of when building software today, and the things you should pay attention to for the future.
