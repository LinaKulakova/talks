Description
-----------

Each and every day, the delight we create when successfully helping clients reach their goals contributes to a great Customer Experience. This, in turn, becomes a driver towards retention and promotion, with clients referring you to others.

In this talk, I'll go over what Customer Experience is and how each team helps improve it. During it, I'll also share my views on how Support becomes a major factor, from the way your engineers attend to client requests, resolution times and SLA upkeep.

Started out as a Java backend engineer developing white-label telecom products. Eventually became responsible for their delivery to a major telecom company, ensuring they reliably served millions of users. With daily contact with clients, I decided to explore Customer Support, which brought upon new challenges and obstacles. These days, I'm a team lead on Feedzai's awesome Support team!
