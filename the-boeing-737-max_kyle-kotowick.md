The Boeing 737 MAX - Human Factors in Complex Systems
=================================================

* Speaker   : Kyle Kotowick, Ph.D.
* Available : Any day
* Length    : 60 minutes
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

The two fatal crashes of the Boeing 737 MAX have sent shock waves through the aerospace community, raising serious questions about design decisions and software algorithms used in the aircraft's flight control systems. After 346 deaths, we have all been reminded of the importance of rigorous design processes and the need to engineer systems for the realities of the end users and their environment. This talk discusses the core principles of designing complex systems for users in high-risk environments and takes a deeper look at what may have gone wrong in Boeing's process.

Extra Information
-----------------

I have given this talk twice so far:

* WebCamp Zagreb 2019, Keynote (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7PNS0QEw0w)
* CodeCamp Cluj-Napoca 2019

Both were very well-received (the WebCamp Zagreb keynote was rated as best talk at the conference), and if possible, I would very much like to give it as a keynote again! While at first it seems more relevant for an engineering conference, the topic is directly relevant to anyone developing any kind of software system or interface. It ties science, engineering, process, and software development together in a unifying way.

While I have not attended PixelsCamp before, I was very intrigued by your description of "Hard-Core" topics. In my mind (opinionated because of my background, certainly), aircraft design and aircraft crashes are some of the most "hard-core" topics I can think of! It's also a realm of software development that doesn't get discussed at most development conferences, so I think it opens up a whole new area of things for devs to think about in their work (or for potential career paths). Having looked through the list (and some videos) of talks from last year's PixelsCamp, with topics ranging from lockpicking to Mars journeys, this seems like the perfect conference to discuss failures in aircraft systems design!

As someone who has spent years researching topics directly related to the causes of these crashes, this talk is certainly very personal to me. Boeing's Director of Large Aircraft Development was a co-instructor of a course I took at MIT, and it's been a bizarre experience watching this unfold.
