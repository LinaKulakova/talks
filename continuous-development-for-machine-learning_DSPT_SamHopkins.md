Description
-----------
In this talk brought to you by the Data Science Portugal meetup, Sam Hopkins will explore the topic of continuous development for machine learning. 

Machine learning and data engineering is becoming commoditized through the rise of performant open source projects and cheap cloud infrastructure. Though these developments, we now are starting to see a significant workforce that can use the base machine learning tools to train predictive models. 

What is typically not present in the typical profile of a Machine Learning worker is a strong DevOps and Software Engineering skill sets that the world of application development has enjoyed in recent years. What this means is that the most interesting challenges in the field of predictive modeling are shifting from the training of performant models to creating an environment in which rapid release cycles can be achieved. 

In this talk, we will focus on a use case and a set of technologies in which this paradigm has been achieved and as resulted in accurate predictions and rapid iteration on a mission-critical sales forecasting project.
