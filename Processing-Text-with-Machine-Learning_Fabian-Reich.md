Description
-----------

Lately, it seems like everyone is talking about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learningâ€¦
When this hype started, I got a little stressed by all these new terms. What does it all mean for me as a developer?

In this talk we will end the confusion and look at some of the ML fundamentals.
We will be learning the fundamentals by building a simple sentiment classifier.
A sentiment classifier can determine whether a written review was positive or negative.
The goal is not to make you a data scientist, but to teach you some of the ML fundamentals.
You will get a better idea of which of your problems might be solved by using ML.

Speaker Bio
-----------

Computer Scientist turned Data Scientist (Hoppfully not the dark side).

During my career I had the big chance to work in the research center of SAP in the Sillicon Vally.
Hence my specialization in the Natural Language Processing/Machine Learning area.

Because I am convinced that AI can solve new kinds of problems, I  co-founded a German Startup called AI-Coaching(www.coach-bot.de).
Which focuses on how we can coach people to help them learn social skills using Coach-Bots(Chatbots focusing on Coaching).
