Description
-----------

When I was accepted into Google Summer of Code program, I was a total beginner at Open Source. 
I did some very small contributions but was still very intimidated by Open Source. 
I started the program as a student working on the project I proposed with the help of my mentors and community and after it ended I became a maintainer. 
As a contributor, I had to work on projects I didnâ€™t know much as a maintainer I had to make sure the project was ready and friendly to outside contributors. 
In this talk, I want to share my learnings and perspective from working in Open Source being on both sides, 
while sharing some tips on how to start contributing to a new project and keeping a project beginner friendly.
