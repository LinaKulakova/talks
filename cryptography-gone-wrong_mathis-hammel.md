Cryptography Gone Wrong
=================================================

* Speaker   : Mathis Hammel
* Available : first day, second day
* Length    : 60 minutes
* Language  : English

Description
-----------

Cryptography is a vital component of cybersecurity. Despite the apparent simplicity of modern cryptosystems, any small mistake can bear disastrous consequences.

This conference takes a deep dive inside several cryptographic disasters of the last decade caused by simple implementation errors, often contained in one line of code or a small cryptographic oversight.

Through the source code or reverse engineering of the affected software, we study the root cause and the way to exploit each failure.

Extra Information
-----------------

A short (30-minute) version of this talk was given at NetSecureDay 2019 (600 attendees). It has met very positive reception, and I'd like to propose it to a broader audience, not only cybersecurity enthusiasts. The slides of the short version are available at the following URL : https://blog.h25.io/talks/NSD19_Cryptography_Gone_Wrong.pdf

This can serve as a practical introduction to many notions in cryptography for developers and tech enthusiasts. The talk will introduce the following notions with real-world examples :

- Symmetric cryptography
- Asymmetric cryptography
- Random number generation
- Side-channel attacks
