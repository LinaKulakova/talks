Description
-----------

Technology today works quite differently from when I and a generation of early internet adopters started our careers back in the 90s. I'm as excited about what we can do with all the tools we have today, as I'm slightly disappointed with the growing disconnect between the "frameworks generation" and the "bare-bones-down-to-silicon-how-does-this-work" old school way of thinking, which I miss.

This talk will be a hands-on time-traveling journey. I will go deep into the technologies, hacks, and ways of working in the 90s, explaining what we learned from them, and how it all helped us become the technologists we are today.
