A Tour of ActivityPub
=====================

* Speaker   : Diogo Cordeiro
* Available : Any
* Length    : 30 minutes
* Language  : Portuguese

Description
-----------

The ActivityPub protocol is a decentralized social networking protocol based upon the ActivityStreams 2.0 data format. It provides a client to server API for creating, updating and deleting content, as well as a federated server to server API for delivering notifications and content.

In this talk, we will go for a small tour through the history of the Fediverse, the context in which ActivityPub was introduced, the internals of its implementation among other challenges we find on the software and networks engineering of a federated social network.

Speaker Bio
-----------

I'm Diogo and I am a Computer Science student from University of Porto. I've a keen interest in scalable and federated software engineering and I'm the current lead developer of GNU social, a free software social networking platform. In it, I've implemented support for ActivityPub and ActivityStreams 2.0 - state-of-the-art W3C recommendations of 2018 and 2017, respectively) for federated social networks.

Extra Information
-----------------

This talk would be an adapted version of a seminar I gave at DCC-FCUP (Computer Science Department of the University of Porto) targeted at Network and Information Systems Engineering master students. The seminar resources were made available at https://www.diogo.site/projects/ActivityPub_seminar/ .

Major topics to be covered during the talk:

- The IndieWeb
- Briefing of OStatus
- WebFinger
- ActivityStreams
- Overview of the Actor model
- ActivityPub

At the end of this journey, we should be able to better understand some of the advantages of this kind of social platforms as well as some of the technical complications in their maintenance and conception.
