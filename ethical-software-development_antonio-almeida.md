Description
-----------

The late 2010s featured numerous privacy and ethical scandals involving tech giants such as Facebook and Google. A wave of technical activists have risen to fight this and related issues, such as climate emergency, sustainable startup funding, and big tech lobbying.

In other words, Software is now political.

What is the role of the average Software Engineer in these fights? This talk will show what choices of the software development cycle have an impact and how we're unwillingly part of the problem, specially in cloud based software. 

I'll provide guidelines and concrete technical solutions towards fully ethical software while maintaining professional standards.

Extra Information

The talk follows the anti Big Tech, privacy first, no data-hauling stance fiercely defended by "Software Activists". One of faces of this movement is [@dhh](https://twitter.com/dhh), creator of Ruby on Rails (honorable mention to [@aral](https://twitter.com/aral)).
The talk will cover industry wide research on how to comply with the ethical requests and apply them on one's Software.
