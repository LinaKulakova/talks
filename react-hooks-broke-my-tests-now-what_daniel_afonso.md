Description
-----------

Hooks have become a better and cleaner way to write React code. Many are now realizing it and starting to migrate their solutions from class to functional components. When the code looks great, and the migration seems successful, your tests may disagree.
This presentation focuses on the common pitfalls of testing and what we have been doing wrong while also teaching you how to test your brand new hooks, all this while using the React Testing Library.

Extra Information
-----------------

I’ve been advocating for better testing practices using the Testing Library and am one of its contributors. After spending months of refactoring implementation details focused tests, I’ve grown to understand the main pain points of testing React components and helped my team to build new practices and write better performant and resistant tests.
